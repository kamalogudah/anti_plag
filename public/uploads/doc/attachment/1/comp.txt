Sherlock performs an N2 comparison between all the files, so every file is compared with every other file.
The output lists the similarity indexes between each pair of files. This index is a percentage, where 0% means no similarity and 100% means there is a very high chance of a lot of similarity. 100% does not mean that the files are exactly the same, since the Sherlock program randomly throws away some data in order to perform a faster match.

The output of the program might look like this:

   README and index.html: 5%
   README and makefile: 1%
   README and sherlock: 0%
   README and sherlock.c: 2%
   index.html and makefile: 8%
   index.html and sherlock: 0%
   index.html and sherlock.c: 10%
   makefile and sherlock: 0%
   makefile and sherlock.c: 6%
   sherlock and sherlock.c: 0%
(The threshold is normally 20%, so the above output would not ordinarily be shown. The example used a threshold lowered to 0% in order to see all similarities. The numbers are fake, however, and just for illustrational purposes.)
In the example, the most similar files are index.html and sherlock.c with a rating of 10%. This means that approximately 10% of the material in those two files might be overlapping (i.e. appear in both files).
